# Web Programming HW#1

Hi, my name is 和毅. Nice to meet you! <3

Some functions:
1. Hover into profile -> show function bar -> hover again -> become darker
2. RWD -> Suitable font-size 
3. Button mic-off on the bottom -> click to "switch" mute or unmute

Intoduction:
1. Me, 和毅, in the main window, so pin on the left-bottom shows 『你』. In addition, I am muted on the right top. You can move your cursor into profile to trigger the function bar, then you can choose between 3 buttons.
2. We have 5 rabbits on the right in each window, all of them has own names and be muted. Their name will be hidden if the size of window is too small.
3. On the bottom, we have three div, containg unique information. First part is on the left showing time and name of the meeting which is the course. The font-size will become smaller if the size of window is too small. Secondly, we have some individual buttons in the middle, they are independant, not a screenshot. The first left button can be click to switch mute or unmute. Finally, we have some buttons on the left. 

By the way, I am finding team members in this course, if you are willing to invite me, that would be great! Thanks! 

我正在尋找組員，如果有同學們願意收留我，我會很開心ＸＤ 謝謝！
